# Introduction
One of the tools used by governments to plan for the development of and investment in its 
population, is the census data. This report analyses the census data of a modestly sized town 
located between two significantly bigger cities to provide recommendations for spending on 
futuristic services and to make cases for developments on undeveloped property. The report 
is divided into two sections. The first section deals with the data cleaning â€“ removal of 
inconsistent and inaccurate data and some data imputation to fix missing information issues. 
The later part analyses the cleaned data using visualisation and statistical inferences to gain 
insights, and uses the insights gained to make the recommendations on the course of action 
to be taken by the government.
